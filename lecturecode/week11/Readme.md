JavaFX Graphics Demo Application
A simple JavaFX application demonstrating basic graphics capabilities and user interaction. The application features a movable blue circle that responds to keyboard input and plays background music.
Features

Interactive blue circle that can be moved using arrow keys
Welcome message with custom font (Comic Sans MS)
Background music (Cantina Band theme)
Simple and clean user interface

Prerequisites

Java 8 or higher
JavaFX (included in Java 8, separate download for Java 11+)
Eclipse IDE with e(fx)clipse plugin
Sound file: sounds/CantinaBand60.wav in project root directory

Setup Instructions

Clone or download the project
Open Eclipse IDE
Import the project as an existing Java project
Ensure JavaFX is properly configured in your build path
Place the required sound file in the sounds directory
Run Main.java as a Java Application

Controls

Use the arrow keys to move the blue circle:

↑ (UP): Move up
↓ (DOWN): Move down
← (LEFT): Move left
→ (RIGHT): Move right



Technical Details

Built using JavaFX 8
Uses FXML for UI layout
Implements event handling for keyboard input
Utilizes JavaFX's Media API for audio playback
Scene graph-based rendering

Development Notes

The circle's movement is implemented using JavaFX's Transform class
Circle color changes slightly when moved
Event handling is managed through the MainController class
UI layout is defined in Main.fxml using SceneBuilder-compatible format

Known Issues

Circle movement might need bounds checking to prevent moving outside the window
Transform-based movement accumulates transformations which might affect performance over time

Future Improvements

Add bounds checking for circle movement
Implement smoother animation transitions
Add more interactive elements
Include volume control for background music
Add collision detection with other shapes
